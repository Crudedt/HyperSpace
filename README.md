### How can I contribute?

-   Feel free to comment on any issues you find interesting
-   You can also open up your own issues, whether for coding up new features based of the concept art, code refactoring, design improvement, etc
-   If you have any questions, open up a new issue with the tag 'question'
-   Don't by shy, we accept any help from beginner programmers (we're beginners too)

### Nice, but how do I start adding things?

Step by step:
1. Fork our project (also include branch 'dev' in your fork)
2. Create a new branch in your fork (the new branch should be based from branch 'dev')
3. To run our project, simply do the following in the terminal:
```
npm i
npm start
```
4. Begin coding by adding / modifying things
5. Run the project to see the results (make sure there are no errors)
6. Make a pull request from your fork's new branch to our project's branch 'dev'. Don't forget to follow our naming conventions section above.
